# Online_Voting_System
Website created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript


Created a Online Voting System webiste that stores the vote of a person and displays the total count of votes obtained by each party.
The website is divided in parts where the person initially is redirected to the login page where if the user has not registered, it will not proceed to the website further.
It has a link that redirects to register page where user has to register themselves to give the vote.
Then the user comes to page where the option is given to select the respective party to give the vote and submit the vote.
The user get to the page with the details of who he/she has voted to.
At the end it gives a link to view the total count of votes obtained by each party.
The total website was created using html, css and javascript for both logic and backend support.
